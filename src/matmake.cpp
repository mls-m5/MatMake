 * The main file to be compiled
 * Notice that the design pattern of this file is not to be used
 * for inspiration in any actual program. The single source file design
 * is simply chosen to be able to compile the whole build system with one
 * command line on any system.
 *
 * To build matmake run "make" in parent directory, or run eqvivalent to
 * `c++ matmake.cpp -std=c++14 -o ../matmake`
